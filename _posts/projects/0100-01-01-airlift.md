Airlift is a rapid web development framework designed to work with cloud infrastructure. Lucid Technics uses Airlift to rapidly build secure and scalable cloud based applications.  Much of the software created using Airlift is generated from Dictation Lucid Technics' human readable business requirements language.

Lucid Technics can generate software for many modes of business functionality that are often coded by hand.  These include the mundane data formatting, conversion, and validation, as well as the more challenging functionality such as automatic data auditing, user action undo and redo, and role based security.  This advanced code generation apapratus allows us to rapidly stand up your web application or site, thereby allowing us to spend less time on infrastructure code, and more time on your web application's look and feel.
