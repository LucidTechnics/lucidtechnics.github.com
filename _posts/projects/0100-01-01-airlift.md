Airlift is Lucid Technics' rapid web development framework designed to work with cloud infrastructures. We use Airlift to rapidly build secure and scalable cloud applications.  Much of the software created using Airlift is generated from Dictation, Lucid Technics' human readable business requirements language.

Using Dictation with Airlift, Lucid Technics can generate software to deliver many modes of business functionality that are often coded by hand.  These include the mundane, like data formatting, data conversion, and data validation.  They also include more challenging application functionality, such as automatic data auditing, robust data encryption, user action undo and redo, and role based security.

Our advanced code generation apparatus allows us to rapidly stand up your web application or site, thereby allowing us to spend less time on infrastructure code, and more time on your web application's look and feel.
