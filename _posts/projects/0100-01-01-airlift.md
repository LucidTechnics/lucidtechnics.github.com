Airlift is Lucid Technics' open source rapid web development framework designed to work with cloud infrastructures. We use Airlift to rapidly build secure and scalable cloud applications.  Much of the software created using Airlift is generated from <a href="http://lucidtechnics.github.com/projects/airlift.html">Airlift</a>, Lucid Technics' open source human readable business requirements language.

Using Dictation with Airlift, Lucid Technics can generate software to deliver many modes of business functionality that are often coded by hand.  These include common application functionality such as data formatting, data conversion, and data validation.  They also include more challenging application functionality, such as automatic data auditing, robust data encryption, user action undo and redo, and role based security.

Our advanced code generation apparatus enables Lucid Technics to rapidly stand up your web applications, thereby allowing us to spend less time on infrastructure code, and more time on your business workflow requirements.
