Office of Personnel Management (OPM)

ReSTful Web Services, Data Visualization, Agile Leadership.


Lucid created a prototype of web services using Airlift, an open source code generator for Google App Engine. The web service's purpose is to verify that status of an employee to determine if they are active and for what agency. The web service returned both JSON and HTML automatically and demonstrated that using both code generation, Restful Web Services, and cloud computing supporting a large volume of traffic was possible without a large cost.

In the end, the implementation used the existing hardware infrastructure. One of the key expectations for the web service is speed.  Lucid created the architecture using the minimum amount of technology to create a web service that is simple yet scalable.  As part of the architecture, a NoSQL database called Redis is used as the primary data source.  Redis is more than a cache as it can hold multiple types of data structures.  Redis was also chosen for performance reasons since it runs on the same server as the web service and entirely in memory, leaving a very small footprint.

In the future, the goal is to build on the web services and provide access to human resources data while maintaining the high performance.


Lucid is creating dashboards to demonstrate how to effectively view the large volumes of human resources data using innovative data visualization techniques.  Creating simple visual representations of data is a challenge where there are seemingly streams of unconnected data. Lucid is connecting the dots and presenting stakeholders with visual data that will be used to take action.
