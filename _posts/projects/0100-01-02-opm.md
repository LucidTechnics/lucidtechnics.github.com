The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) needed a way to securely expose the large amount of the Federal Government employee status information to authorized parties.  Lucid Technics rapidly created a web services prototype using Airlift, our open source code generator for Google App Engine.  This Airlift generated prototype demonstrated how web services could be constructed in order to verify the activity status of a government employee.

Due to Airlift's flexible design, the web service was constructed to automatically return data in multiple representation formats, including JSON and HTML.  Within 16 hours of coding Lucid Technics demonstrated that using code generation coupled with cloud computing, creating web services capable of supporting large volumes of traffic was possible at minimal cost to the taxpayer.

The prototype demonstration was a huge success and led to an Lucid Technics architected implementation that used the OPM's existing hardware infrastructure.

Lucid Technics is currently exploring ways to build on these web services, thereby providing access to more human resources data while still maintaining security.  Creating simple means of presenting employee data is a challenge when there are large amounts of loosely connected data. Lucid Technics is presenting stakeholders with visual data dashboard presentations that can be used to better understand that large employee data set.
