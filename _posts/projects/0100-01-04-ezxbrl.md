Ez-XBRL Solutions provides first class document annotation services for professional corporate filers as well as publicly traded companies in the United States.

Annotating a corporate filing is an extremely manual process.  Lucid Technics is currently working with Ez-XBRL Solutions on solving this problem using machine learning and predictive analytics.  Our goal is to completely change how the annotation of corporate filings is accomplished in the United States.

We are developing a comprehensive suite of natural language processing tools to accomplish this task, and expect to demonstrate automatic annotation capabilities within the next year.
