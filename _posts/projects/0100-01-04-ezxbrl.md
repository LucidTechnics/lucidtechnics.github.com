EZ-XBRL Solutions provides first class document annotation services for professional corporate filers as well as publicly traded companies in the United States.

Annotating a corporate filing is an extremely manual process.  Lucid Technics is currently working with EZ-XBRL on solving this problem usig machine learning and predictive analytics.  Our goal is to completely change how corporate filing annotations are done in the United States.

We are developing a comprehensive suite of natural language tools to accomplish this task, and expect to demonstrate automatic annotation capabilities within the next year.
