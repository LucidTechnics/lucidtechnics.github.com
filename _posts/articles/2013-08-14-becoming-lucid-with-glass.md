## Becoming Lucid with Google Glass
<img src="http://www.ultraimg.com/images/j4MYI.jpg" border="0" />

A few weeks ago, I became a member of the Google Glass Explorers program and I picked up my Glass in New York.  At this point, I had already dabbled with creating applications for Glass ever since trying them on for the first time.  That first time was "magic" and I thought: **"We made it to the future"**.  Since then, it has become more clear on how Glass and similar devices will change our lives.

_Glass is personal._  When I first got Glass, my wife and I walked around Chelsea in NYC.  I was amazed at the quality of pictures Glass can take. Even more amazing is how little effort needed to find take and share pictures or find the nearest Thai restaurants. I think it is the closest we can get to technology without being embedded in our person.  I have been using Glass to capture the fleeting moments of my children's childhood. I recently attended their Tae Kwon Do graduation and held their boards for them to break.  I recorded it from my perspective.  I then showed the to them when we got home and shared with family and friends. Think about that.  Glass has become almost invisible and I find myself trying to take a picture or video when I don't have them on.

Glass is also for work.  I believe many industries will be using some form of wearable device in the near future.  From the system administrator to the structural engineer to the educators, Glass will be everywhere and invisible. Glass and other devices will become mainstream because of the effortless use and because of the near  instant response.  However, right now we are in the so called "hype cycle" of Glass and many are creating applications for Glass without understanding how different it is from other devices.  Designing for Glass is not like designing for a website.  Take news media applications, if your news site is sending Glass notifications too frequently, what will users do.  What will users do if they keep getting bad news or see an emotionally jarring photo of conflict?  Remember, Glass is personal. That notification from Glass, a quick look up and you are looking at a card in your timeline.  You are not perusing a website, that card is right there.

I believe Glass is a game changer in ways I have not even thought of yet.  I look forward to creating all types of interesting applications for Glass.  I don't know the future.  I don't know how this Glass story ends but I know we are in the future and this is just the beginning.
