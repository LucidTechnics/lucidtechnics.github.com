All you have to do is forking the repository and make your own adjustments.

Adjust Configuration
-----------------

Make sure you setup `_config.yml` correctly.

If your page lives under `http://username.github.com/sitename` your config.yml looks like this:

    auto: true
    server: true
    permalink: none
    baseurl: "sitename"
    exclude:
    - .gitignore
    - README.md


Use Prose.io to edit the contents of your site
-----------------

It was challenging, but Prose supports OAuth. I think it's very important to use OAuth over Basic Authentication, since Github data can be very sensible and no one wants to risk getting his password sniffed.

**Browse**


Once you have selected a repository, you can browse your posts and sub-folders in a traditional file-browser-ish manner. You can create new files here as well, which immediately opens an empty document for you, which you can save after populating it with some text.

We use CodeMirror, a great software that makes browser-based editing a pleasure (the first time). Compared to a regular textarea, which has an annoying inline scoller this is a huge step forward I think.
