## Becoming Lucid with Google Glass

A few weeks ago, I became a member of the Google Glass Explorers program and I picked up my Glass in New York.  At this point, I had already dabbled with creating applications for Glass ever since trying them on for the first time.  That first time was "magic" and I thought: **"We made it to the future"**.  Since then, it has become more clear on how Glass and similar devices will change our lives.

**_Glass is personal._**  When I first got Glass, my wife and I walked around Chelsea in NYC.  I was amazed at the picture quality from Glass. Even more amazing is how little effort needed to find take and share pictures or find the nearest Thai restaurants. I think it is the closest we can get to technology (right now) without it being embedded in our person.  I have been using Glass to capture the fleeting moments of my children's childhood. I recently attended their Tae Kwon Do graduation and held their boards for them to break.  I recorded it from my perspective.  I then showed them the videos when we got home and shared with family and friends. Think about that.  Glass has become almost invisible and I find myself trying to take a picture or video even when I don't have them on.

**_Glass is also for work._**  I believe many industries will be using some form of wearable device in the near future.  From the system administrator to the structural engineer to the educators, Glass will be everywhere and invisible. By this I mean Glass and other devices will become mainstream because of the effortless use and because of the near instant response.  However, right now we are in the so called "hype cycle" of Glass and many are creating applications for Glass without understanding how different it is from other devices.  Designing for Glass is not like designing for a website.  Take news media applications, if your news site is sending Glass notifications too frequently, users may flock.  What will users do if they keep getting bad news or see an emotionally jarring photo of conflict?  Remember, Glass is personal. You get a notification from Glass, a quick look up and you are looking at a card in your timeline.  You are not perusing a website, that card is _right_ there.

Glass is a game changer in ways I have not even thought of yet.  The first wave of apps are just that, the first wave.  The next wave of apps will use more of the capabilities of Glass such as the gyroscope, accelerometer, and magnetometer sensors.  Last week, I went back up to New York to the Google Glass Basecamp for a meetup with other explorers.  What I took away from talking to the wide range of explorers is that there is a great potential for apps to change the way we work.  Whether your works revolves around a construction site, writing, or making art.  We can use Glass to enhance what we already are doing by making it easier or what I like to call 'less friction'.  The easier something is to do, the more likely a user will repeat the action.  I take many pictures and video (I have less than 8 GB left, should probably start deleting since they are automatically backed up on Google+).  That could mean comparing updated blueprints to a construction site or getting notifications for the nearest kid friendly park.     

Finally, I don't know the future.  I don't know how this Glass story ends but I know we are _in_ the future and this is just the beginning.
