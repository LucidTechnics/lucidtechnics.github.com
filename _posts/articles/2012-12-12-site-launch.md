Over the last couple of years or so, Dave and I have been quite busy.  We have created a cloud based framework for creating web applications and called it [Airlift](http://lucidtechnics.github.com/projects/airlift.html). We also created a business friendly requirements gathering language used to generate Airlift code and called it [Dictation](http://lucidtechnics.github.com/projects/dictation.html).  We have used these open source tools to do wonderful things for our clients, automating their manual processes using the cloud, the web, and artificial intelligence.

As a matter of fact we were so busy doing these things, we were unable to spend much time on ourselves. Paramount in this neglect was our own website.  Quite frankly it was terrible. The biggest problem with it was that we could not use our site to let the world know that we existed and that we were doing cool things. 

So we decided to change that.  First we thought hard about the things we needed our website to be able to do.  Then we looked at other companies' websites, and talked to other people to see what they thought.  When we were done we knew the qualities we wanted to have for our new website ...

* It should be HTML based.  No flash or animations or anything fancy.  We should be able to tell the world what we are doing using just text and images.
* It should be social.  If our fans like what we are doing here, it should be easy for them to tell others.
* It should be easy to maintain.  When we have something to say, we should be able to just write it and it will appear on our site.  A non-technical person should be able to do this as easy as we techies are able to do it.
* It should be easy to change.  When we get tired of one presentation we should be able to move to another presentation or style with minimal effort.  No need to call in a design expert to get that done. (No offense to any design experts out there.)
* It should be highly available.  No outages!
* It should cost us nothing to host.  Actually this was not a requirement, but it turned out to be true as well.

We were able to meet all of these requirements.  We still had a time crunch problem so we decided to secure some help. Through the work of Michael Aufrieter and Vincent Saiz of the open source project [Substance](http://substance.io) we were able to quickly redesign, and redeploy our new site.

There are some interesting things to note about our new site.  This website is itself an open source site that runs on Github as a free open source project.  All the content of this site is available on Github and can be freely downloaded by anyone.

We manage the site using [Prose](http://developmentseed.org/blog/2012/june/25/prose-a-content-editor-for-github/).  Prose is a content editor built and based on [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll), a blog aware static site generator.  Prose was created by Michael during his stint at Development Seed when he was here in Washington DC over the summer.  So much thanks goes out to Michael, as well as Eric Gunderson of Development Seed, who without his sponsership of Prose.io development this web site as it stands would not be possible.

If you would like to learn more about how this site was created please send us an email to [info@lucidtechnics.com]("mailto:info@lucidtechnics.com") and we will be more than happy to explain the details.

Otherwise please enjoy our new site and let us know if anything you find here interests you.  We are happy to talk to anyone about the work we have done as well as the projects we have coming down the pipe.

Sincerely,

Bediako and Dave
