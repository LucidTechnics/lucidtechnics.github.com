Over the last couple of years or so, Dave and I have been quite busy.  We have created a cloud based framework called Airlift. We created a business friendly requirements gathering language called Dictation.  We have used these packages to do wonderful things for our clients, automating manual processes using the cloud, the web, and artificial intelligence.

All of this time we have spent working hard for our clients we were unable to spend time on ourselves. Principal in this neglect was our own website.

We knew what it should be but we could not afford the time to pursue it ourselves.  Nevertheless it was clear what we wanted ...

* It should be HTML based.  No flash or animations or anything fancy.  We should be able to tell the world what we are doing using just text and images.
* It should be social.  If our fans like what we are doing here, it should be easy for them to tell others.
* It should be easy to maintain.  When we have something to say. We should be able to just write it and it will appear on our site.  A non-technical person should be able to do this as easy as we are.
* It should be easy to change.  When we get tired of one presentation we should be able to move to another presentation or style with minimal effort.  No need to call in a design expert to get that done. (No offense to any design experts out there.)
* It should be available.  No outages!
* It should be free to run.  Actually this was not a requirement, but it turned out to be true as well.

We were able to meet all of these requirements mainly through the work of Michael Aufrieter and Vincent Saiz of the open source project Substance.  In particular, this website is itself an open source site that runs on Github as a free open source project.  All the content to this site is available on Github and can be freely downloaded by anyone.

We manage the site using [Prose.io](http://prose.io).  Prose.io is a content editor built on top of Jeckyl.  It was created by Michael during his stint at Development Seed when he was here in Washington DC over the summer.  So much thanks goes out to Micheal, as well as Eric Gunderson of Development Seed who without his sponsership of Prose.io this web site would not be possible.

If you would like to learn more about how this site was created please send us an email to info@lucidtechnics.com and we will be more than happy to explain the details.

Otherwise please enjoy our new site and let us know if anything you find here interests you.  We are happy to talk to anyone about the work we have done as well as the projects we have coming down the pipe.

Sincerely,

Bediako and Dave
