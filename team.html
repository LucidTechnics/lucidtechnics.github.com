        <p>
          Ever since learning to program BASIC in elementary school I have been drawn towards software development. I am a technologist with over 10 years of experience and I have created software using a wide range of technologies for a wide range of clients. I have seen first hand the difference Agile methodologies can make on a project and I am a certified Scrum Master and proponent of agile practices. When I am not working on a project I spend my time playing soccer, practicing martial arts, and making my friends and family more tech savvy.
