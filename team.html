        My name is Bediako (say Beh Dee Ah Ko) and I am a software architect with over 13 years of development experience. I have had the opportunity to create software for companies in the financial, retail, manufacturing, telecom, and non-profit arenas. If I am not playing soccer or spending quality time with my family, then I'm thinking about faster ways to build and deploy great software.

        Ever since learning to program BASIC in elementary school I have been drawn towards software development. I am a technologist with over 10 years of experience and I have created software using a wide range of technologies for a wide range of clients. I have seen first hand the difference Agile methodologies can make on a project and I am a certified Scrum Master and proponent of agile practices. When I am not working on a project I spend my time playing soccer, practicing martial arts, and making my friends and family more tech savvy.
